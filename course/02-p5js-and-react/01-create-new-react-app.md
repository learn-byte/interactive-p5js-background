# Creating a React app for our sketch

#### It's nice to have a p5js sketch hosted on p5js.org but what if we want the sketch in our own react app so we can use our own source control?

Let's create a new react app as a playground for future sketches!

First off, install `create-react-app` if you don't already have it installed.  See [Facebook's official documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started) for more information. 

Then, create a new react app that we can use as our animation playground. 

```
npx create-react-app my-animation-app
cd my-animation-app
npm start
```

Your react app should now be running at http://localhost:3000/ and look something like this:
