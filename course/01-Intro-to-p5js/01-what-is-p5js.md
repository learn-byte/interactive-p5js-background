## What is p5.js?

p5.js is a javascript project for developing programmatic visual designs.  It is a spin off of the popular Processing libraries based on Java and Javascript.  With p5.js it is simple to create imagery with code, and even include interactive elements to the imagery.

To check out some examples of what p5.js can do, see their [examples page here](https://p5js.org/examples/).
